# Models for comparing EMI and bidomain models

This repository contains examples of bidomain model cases
on simple, small domains, with different forms of external stimulus
applied. The models will be compared with the EMI model for the same
cases. 

## Prerequisites

You need
[cbcbeat branch stable-2017.2.0](https://bitbucket.org/meg/cbcbeat/branch/stable-2017.2.0),
or
[branch voltage_bcs](https://bitbucket.org/meg/cbcbeat/branch/voltage_bcs)
if you want to apply voltage boundary conditions. 

To get a working installation of cbcbeat, consult the
[docker_workflows]
(https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/docker_workflows.git)
repository. 




## Resources
The FEniCS community has made a very nice resource on how to use
docker as a part of your
[workflow](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/work_flows.html).
